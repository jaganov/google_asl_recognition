    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a deep learning model for American Sign Language (ASL) recognition using Google's ASL dataset. \n",
    "The implementation focuses on temporal sequence modeling with a hybrid architecture combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), LSTM, and Transformer components.\n",
    "\n",
    "American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language of the deaf community in North America, with over 500,000 native users.\n",
    "Automatic ASL recognition presents unique challenges due to the complex spatio-temporal nature of sign gestures, requiring both precise hand shape recognition and temporal motion understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work addresses ASL recognition using the Google ASL dataset from Kaggle competition, which provides pre-computed MediaPipe landmarks (50GB of parquet files) instead of raw video data. We focus on developing a robust recognition system that overcomes the common challenge of overfitting in deep learning models.\n",
    "Our approach combines multiple temporal modeling techniques with novel adaptive regularization strategies, processing the ready-to-use landmark sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/jaganov/google_asl_recognition](https://github.com/jaganov/google_asl_recognition)\n",

    "The overall approach involves:\n",
    "1. **Data Processing**: Loading and preprocessing ASL sign data from Google's parquet files containing MediaPipe landmarks\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Processing pre-computed MediaPipe landmarks (543 points per frame) into rich temporal features\n",
    "3. **Model Training**: Developing and training deep learning models for sign classification\n",
    "4. **Real-time Recognition**: Implementing a live recognition system that uses MediaPipe for webcam input\n",
    "5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the system for GPU acceleration (RTX 4070)\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by providing an accessible, accurate, and real-time ASL recognition tool.\n",
